Brief Description
==================================

These simulation concerns the experimental setup and application example used in our research for
Context-based Thermodynamic Modeling of Building Spaces. It contains simulation files for a single Thermal Zone
using the Buildings Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB) and EnergyPlus. It also contains a Matlab simulation of
the same building, using a Context-based model. The Dataset includes the following files:


Simple.idf: The EnergyPlus input building used in the simulation.
system.xml: The BCVTB system description. 
Model.m: Simulation of the Context-based model.
